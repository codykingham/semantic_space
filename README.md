New description coming soon. This project is entering into phase 3. See [phase 2 readme](phase2/readme.md) for a description of the next steps.

The data used for the analysis is the [ETCBC](http://www.etcbc.nl)'s [BHSA](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa) in [Text-Fabric representation](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/wiki).
